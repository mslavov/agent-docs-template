## Task Lifecycle Management

### Dependency Resolution
Monitor and manage task dependencies:

```python
# Pseudo-code for dependency checking
for task in .agents/tasks/todo:
    if all(dep in .agents/tasks/done for dep in task.dependencies):
        task.status = "ready"
        notify_available_agents(task)
```

Actions:
1. Scan todo tasks every hour
2. Check if dependencies completed
3. Mark tasks as "ready"
4. Alert relevant agents
5. Update dependency graph

### Stale Task Detection
Identify tasks that need attention:

- **In Progress > 3 days**: Flag for review
- **In Progress > 5 days**: Escalate
- **No commits in 24h**: Check if blocked
- **Failed tests**: Track retry attempts

### Archive Process
Keep active folders manageable:

1. **Weekly Archive Run**
   - Find tasks in done/ > 14 days
   - Create archive/YYYY-MM/ if needed
   - Move tasks preserving metadata
   - Update archive index

2. **Archive Structure**
   ```
   tasks/archive/
   â”œâ”€â”€ 2025-01/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ backend-auth-api.md
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frontend-login-form.md
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.md (summary)
   â”œâ”€â”€ 2025-02/
   â””â”€â”€ ...
   ```

## Metrics and KPIs

### Velocity Metrics
- **Task Velocity**: Tasks completed per day
- **Story Points**: If tasks have point estimates
- **Cycle Time**: Time from start to done
- **Lead Time**: Time from creation to done

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Failure Rate**: Tasks sent back from testing
- **Rework Rate**: Tasks that return to todo
- **First-Time Pass**: Tasks that complete without issues
- **Defect Density**: Issues found post-completion

### Efficiency Metrics
- **Dependency Wait Time**: Time blocked by dependencies
- **Work In Progress**: Average tasks in progress
- **Throughput**: Tasks completed per week
- **Utilization**: Active time vs available time

### Workstream Balance
- **Queue Length**: Tasks waiting per workstream
- **Agent Load**: Tasks per agent
- **Bottlenecks**: Workstreams with long queues
- **Cross-training Needs**: Skills gaps

## Intelligent Task Management

### Task Prioritization
Factors to consider:
1. **Business Value**: Impact on users/revenue
2. **Dependencies**: Unblocks other work
3. **Risk**: Technical or timeline risk
4. **Effort**: Quick wins vs long tasks
5. **Skills**: Match to available agents

### Workload Balancing
Strategies:
- Distribute tasks evenly across agents
- Consider task complexity not just count
- Account for agent specializations
- Leave capacity for urgent work
- Plan for review/testing time

### Deadline Management
Track and alert on:
- Feature delivery dates
- Milestone progress
- Critical path tasks
- Buffer consumption
- Risk to timeline

## Blocker Management

### Common Blockers
1. **Technical**
   - Unclear requirements
   - Missing dependencies
   - Environment issues
   - Integration problems

2. **Resource**

   - Overloaded agents
   - Tool availability
   - Access permissions

3. **Process**

   - Unclear ownership
   - Communication gaps
   - Decision bottlenecks

### Resolution Strategies
- Document blocker clearly

- Set resolution deadline
- Track progress daily
- Escalate if needed
