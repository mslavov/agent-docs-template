# Documentation Usage Guidelines

## CRITICAL: Framework-First Reading Order

### ðŸ“š MANDATORY READING ORDER:
1. **FIRST**: Read @RULES.md - Framework rules and development guidelines
2. **SECOND**: Read @INDEX.md - Documentation navigation hub  
3. **THIRD**: Read your agent definition in @agents/ (if applicable)
4. **THEN**: Consult project-specific documentation as needed

## Pre-Task Protocol

1. **Verify you've read the framework docs** - @RULES.md and @INDEX.md are mandatory
2. **Review relevant documentation** - Use @INDEX.md to find specific docs
3. **Check the Quick Task Lookup** - Find the right documents for your task type
4. **Read @system-overview.md** for system understanding when needed
5. **Consult product documents** from docs/product as needed
6. **Reference technical docs** from docs/tech as needed

## Post-Task Protocol

1. Update the single authoritative source for any changed information
2. Update cross-references if new relationships are created
3. Mark task completion in @progress.md
4. Update @INDEX.md if new documents are created
